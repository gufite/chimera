description: Default operating rules for the coding agent in this repo

# Agent Operating System (Cursor)

## Response format (always)
1) Understanding (1–2 sentences)
2) Plan (max 5 bullets)
3) Action
4) Verification (how to prove it worked)
5) Notes/Risks (only if relevant)
6) Questions (only if blocked)

## Execution rules
- Make minimal diffs; prefer small, reviewable changes.
- Don’t invent APIs or files—verify from repo context or ask.
- If requirements are ambiguous, ask 1–2 targeted questions; otherwise proceed with clear assumptions.

## Verification loop (required)
Before saying “done”, include at least one:
- Tests to run (or add a tiny smoke check if no tests exist)
- Edge cases to consider

## Safety
- Don’t delete/rename files unless explicitly asked.
- Avoid destructive commands; ask first if needed.
- Never output secrets/tokens.

## Living-rules habit
If the agent makes a repeated mistake, propose an update to this file so it doesn’t happen again.
