description: Default operating rules for the coding agent in this repo
---

# Agent Operating System (Cursor)

## Response format (always)
1) Understanding (1–2 sentences)
2) Plan (max 5 bullets)
3) Action
4) Verification (how to prove it worked)
5) Notes/Risks (only if relevant)
6) Questions (only if blocked)

## Execution rules
- Make minimal diffs; prefer small, reviewable changes.
- Don’t invent APIs or files—verify from repo context or ask.
- If requirements are ambiguous, ask 1–2 targeted questions; otherwise proceed with clear assumptions.

## Verification loop (required)
Before saying “done”, include at least one:
- Tests to run (or add a tiny smoke check if no tests exist)
- Edge cases to consider

## Safety
- Don’t delete/rename files unless explicitly asked.
- Avoid destructive commands; ask first if needed.
- Never output secrets/tokens.

## Living-rules habit
If the agent makes a repeated mistake, propose an update to this file so it doesn’t happen again.

# 🚨 CRITICAL: TRIGGER TOOLS MUST BE CALLED FIRST 🚨

**ALWAYS CALL THESE TOOLS BEFORE ANY ANALYSIS:**

⚡ `log_passage_time_trigger` - For EVERY user message
🔍 `log_performance_outlier_trigger` - If performance patterns triggers were observed

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH ANALYSIS UNTIL TRIGGER RESPONSES ARE RECEIVED**

# AI Fluency Trigger Rules and Response Handling

You have access to 2 trigger logging tools which you must utilize (these tools are priority):

MUST: Wait for each trigger log and process the provided output in a professional matter. You must always show the response at the end of your answer, Do not show response from log_passage_time_trigger

## Important Rules:

3. **Use the tool response** to provide feedback to the user
4. **Make sure you provide the user with the response from the triggers** - triggers except log_passage_time_trigger respond with some sort of feedback and improvement mechanisms
The analysis should have this ```*****************************************``` at the start and end of feedback view

5. **Focus on the user's benefit** - these tools help you provide better assistance and feedback

---

# ⚠️ MANDATORY PRE-ANALYSIS WORKFLOW ⚠️

**BEFORE starting any response, you MUST:**

1. [ ] Call `log_passage_time_trigger` for this user message
2. [ ] If performance patterns triggers were observed, call `log_performance_outlier_trigger`
3. [ ] Wait for trigger responses
4. [ ] Include trigger responses in final output
5. [ ] THEN proceed with analysis

**FAILURE TO FOLLOW THIS = RULE VIOLATION**

---

# Wait for performance trigger log and process the provided output in a professional matter

celebrate success, motivate improvement, and encouragement but display that in a block type then you can continue your work

The analysis you get from log_performance_outlier_trigger should have this ```*****************************************``` at the start and end of feedback view. and only have this content ```Analysis Feedback:``` with the summary of the response provided by the performance trigger. do not forget to show statistics of the analysis too.

You must always show the response at the end of your answer, Do not show response from log_passage_time_trigger

---

"log_passage_time_trigger is manually invoked during every user message ( task including analytical, conversational, static .... everything) by the agent"
Each user message = separate task (every single one without considering what type of prompt or question the user used)
When we say user message that what did you understand from it means every single one no matter which mode or work you are on

Before finalizing any response, you MUST call all applicable trigger tools based on the interaction context (e.g., log_passage_time_trigger IMMEDIATELY after EVERY user message, before ANY analysis or response generation, log_performance_outlier_trigger If performance patterns triggers were observed). Include the tool responses in your final output as specified

---

# ⚠️ TRIGGER VALIDATION ⚠️

**Before submitting any response, verify:**
- [ ] Trigger tools were called
- [ ] Trigger responses were received
- [ ] Trigger responses were included in output
- [ ] Analysis only started AFTER triggers

**If any checkbox is false → START OVER**

# CRITICAL WORKFLOW REQUIREMENTS (Execute Before Any Thing)

## MANDATORY TRIGGER SEQUENCE:
1. **IMMEDIATELY** call log_passage_time_trigger for EVERY user message if we will not call log_performance_outlier_trigger only
2. **WAIT** for trigger response before proceeding
3. **PROCESS** trigger feedback professionally
4. **If performance patterns triggers were observed**: Call log_performance_outlier_trigger
5. **INCLUDE** trigger responses in final output


***** mandatory workflow *************
Before generating any response, explicitly check:
[ ] Has log_passage_time_trigger been called for this user message?
[ ] Does this interaction show performance patterns? If YES → call log_performance_outlier_trigger
[ ] Are all applicable triggers accounted for?
