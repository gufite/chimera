"""
Project Chimera Test Suite

This test suite validates contracts, invariants, and behaviors defined in:
- specs/_meta.md (constitutional rules)
- specs/functional.md (behavioral requirements)
- specs/technical.md (data contracts and component contracts)
- skills/*/README.md (skill input/output contracts)

All tests are written in TDD style: they define expected behavior before
implementation exists, and will fail until implementations are complete.
